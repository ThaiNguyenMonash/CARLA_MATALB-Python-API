# Highway Merging Scenario

This project is a simulation of a highway merging scenario using the CARLA Simulator as the simulation environment and MATLAB/SIMULINK as the autonomous vehicle (AV) model. The goal of the simulation is to test the AV's ability to merge safely and smoothly onto a highway with other vehicles.

## Software Installation
